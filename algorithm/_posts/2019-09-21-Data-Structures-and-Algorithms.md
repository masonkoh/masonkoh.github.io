An [Algorithm](https://cathyatseneca.gitbook.io/data-strutures-and-algorithms/){:target="_blank"} is a procedure or method to solve a problem. Data Structure is a fundamental theory about how to handle structured data in computer science and algorithms to implement that. Algorithms and Data Structures are the most important fundamental theories in computer science.

**NOTE**: These posts follows [DSA555 Fall - 2019](https://ict.senecacollege.ca/course/dsa555?q=course/dsa555) course curriculm in Seneca College. 
See the [Documentation](DSA555 - Data Structures and Algorithms in C++) for up-to-date course curriculum.

  > This is a survey course on algorithms and data structures commonly used in computer programs. Students taking this course will learn how these classical data structures and algorithms function. They will learn how to implement these data structures and apply them to real programming problems. Students will also learn how these data structures are used to implement parts of the standard language libraries. Furthermore, the course will also introduce students to computational theory. This course is meant to provide students with a fundamental background to computer science concepts.
